benchx

This is small benchmark program to test the throughput of low-level drawing primitives in the X
server. It supports 16bpp and 32bpp.

Usage:
	benchx <testname>

where <testname> is one of the following:

	CopyArea		Screen to screen blits.
	AlignedCopyArea		Aligned screen to screen blits (e.g. vertical scrolling).
	FillRect		Rectangle fill.
	PutImage		Slow Putimage using Xlib pipes.
        ShmPutImage		Faster Putimage using MIT shared memory.
        AlignedShmPutImage	Same but destination x-coordinate is aligned to multiple of 8.
        ShmPixmapCopy		CopyArea from shared memory pixmap to screen.
        AlignedPixmapCopy	Same but destination position is aligned to multiple of 8.
	All			Run all tests.

Run benchx without arguments for the full list.

It is best run on a bare X server without a window manager, because otherwise the root window may be
obscured. To do so, create or edit the file .xinitrc in your home directory so that has the single
line:

benchx <testname> > benchx.out

If you then start the X server using startx, it will automatically run the specified test,
and the X server should exit after it is finished. A sample xinitrc file that runs all the tests
is provided.

Note about PutImage performance:

The tests PutImage, [Aligned]ShmPutImage and [Aligned]PixmapCopy depend highly on CPU caches.
As the size of the image increases, it may no longer fit into the L2 cache of the CPU, that's
why bandwidth decreases for the largest sizes.
